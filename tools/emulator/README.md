# Emulator test suite

Scripts to run the Wazeomatic Android pieces on an emulator set up like the Pixel 9 Pro
(1280x2856, 495 dpi) against **mock Waze** (`android/mockwaze`) instead of real Waze.
Everything stays on F: (SDK, AVDs under `F:\dev\android-sdk\.android\avd`, outputs under
`runs\emulator\`).

Our emulator is AVD `pixel9pro_test` on port **5554** (`emulator-5554`). Every script only uses
that serial, so the detector team's `wazeomatic_dev` on 5560 is never touched.

## Quick start (PowerShell, repo root)

```powershell
$ps = 'powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File'
iex "$ps tools\emulator\create_avd.ps1"            # once; -Webcam for back cam = webcam0, -Force to recreate
iex "$ps tools\emulator\start_emulator.ps1 -Wait"  # -Headless (no window), -Gpu auto|host|swiftshader_indirect, -ColdBoot
iex "$ps tools\emulator\install_apps.ps1 -Build"   # mock Waze + detector APK if built
.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\emulator\run_e2e.py  # Stage A (+ Stage B if the detector exists)
```

| script | what it does |
|---|---|
| `create_avd.ps1` | creates `pixel9pro_test` from the `pixel_9_pro` profile (falls back to the closest Pixel) and forces 1280x2856 @ 495 dpi, 4 GB emulator RAM, 6 cores, back camera `virtualscene` (or `webcam0` with `-Webcam`) in `config.ini` |
| `start_emulator.ps1` | starts it in the background on 5554 (`-gpu auto`), log in `runs\emulator\emulator_5554.log` |
| `wait_for_boot.ps1` | polls `sys.boot_completed`, then unlocks and keeps the screen on |
| `install_apps.ps1` | installs mock Waze and `android/detector/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/*.apk` if present |
| `push_video.ps1` | ffmpeg: `.ogv` -> H.264 720p 30 fps mp4 in `runs\emulator\`, pushed to `/sdcard/Android/data/com.wazeomatic.detector/files/test.mp4` and `/sdcard/Download/` (`-Seconds 60` to trim) |
| `screenshot.ps1` / `screenrecord.ps1` | PNG / mp4 into `runs\emulator\` |
| `run_e2e.py` | the end-to-end test (below) |

## run_e2e.py

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\emulator\run_e2e.py --stage a        # mock Waze only
.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\emulator\run_e2e.py --stage b --stage-b-wait 150
.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\emulator\run_e2e.py --stage b --video-seconds 60 --stage-b-wait 100 --detector-extras "--es class_map car=HAZARD_ON_ROAD_OBJECT --es conf 0.4 --ez dry_run false"
# (the CC0 clips contain no real hazard; the class_map extra makes the detector treat COCO cars as a hazard so the whole chain is exercised)
```

If `adb install` of the detector fails with `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`, the APK already on the emulator was signed with a different debug keystore (another PC or user). Run `adb -s emulator-5554 uninstall com.wazeomatic.detector` once and install again.

Starts the emulator if it is not running (unless `--no-start`), installs mock Waze if missing
(`--install` forces it), and writes `logcat.txt`, screenshots, the pulled `reports.jsonl` /
`macro_events.jsonl` and `summary.txt` to `runs\emulator\<timestamp>\`. Exit code 0 = all PASS.

**Stage A** (mock Waze only):
* A1 taps Report > Hazard > Pothole > Cancel with `adb shell input tap` at the coordinates
  from `uiautomator dump` (same kind of taps the MacroDroid macro does) and expects a
  `dry_run=true` row; a manual Police send grabs the "Thanks!" toast screenshot.
* A2 broadcasts `HAZARD_ON_ROAD_POTHOLE` (`dry_run=false`) and expects exactly one
  `Hazard / Pothole` report from the auto macro.
* A3 broadcasts `CRASH` straight after: must be `suppressed_rate_limit` and nothing sent.
* A4 broadcasts `HAZARD_ON_ROAD_CONSTRUCTION` with `dry_run=true`: must reach the confirm
  sheet, cancel, and log `dry_run=true` with no extra send.
* A5 unknown hazard_type is ignored; A6 `MockWazeReport` lines show up in logcat.

The broadcasts look exactly like what the detector sends:

```
adb -s emulator-5554 shell am broadcast -a com.wazeomatic.HAZARD_DETECTED --es hazard_type HAZARD_ON_ROAD_POTHOLE --es confidence 0.87 --es dry_run false --es source e2e --es waze_category Hazard --es waze_subcategory Pothole
```

**Stage B** (skipped when no detector APK is built or installed): pushes the clip, starts mock
Waze with `bring_to_front=true` (+ `appops set ... SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW allow` so it may come to
the front from the background), launches
`am start -n com.wazeomatic.detector/.MainActivity --es source video --es video test.mp4`,
waits, reads logcat tag `WazeomaticEvent` and checks mock Waze received those events, sent
reports match the schema mapping and the one-per-minute limit held. If the detector logs no
events at all the stage is reported as SKIP (nothing to compare), not PASS.

Note: once mock Waze jumps to the front, the detector goes to the background. If the detector
pauses video playback when it is not visible, run it as a foreground service (its owner's call).

## Camera path instead of video mode (webcam0 + OBS)

The detector's in-app video mode is the easy way. To test the real camera code path instead:

1. Install OBS Studio, add a *Media Source* with `F:\dev\datasets\dashcam\dashcam_urban_1080p.ogv`
   (loop on), and click **Start Virtual Camera**.
2. Recreate or start the AVD with the webcam as back camera:
   `create_avd.ps1 -Webcam -Force` (permanent) or `start_emulator.ps1 -Webcam` (this run only;
   passes `-camera-back webcam0`). Check the name with
   `F:\dev\android-sdk\emulator\emulator.exe -webcam-list`; if OBS is not `webcam0`, use the
   name it shows (e.g. `webcam1`) in `config.ini` (`hw.camera.back`).
3. Start the detector in camera mode; the emulator back camera now shows the OBS clip.

The emulator only enumerates webcams at start-up, so start the OBS virtual camera first.
The default `virtualscene` camera is a 3D room, useful only to check the camera opens.

## Troubleshooting

* `adb devices` shows `emulator-5554 offline`: wait, or `adb -s emulator-5554 emu kill` and start again with `-ColdBoot`.
* Stuck at boot with `-gpu auto`: try `-Gpu swiftshader_indirect` (software, slower).
* `uiautomator dump` fails while an animation runs: A1 retries a few times.
* Reports file: `adb -s emulator-5554 shell cat /sdcard/Android/data/com.wazeomatic.mockwaze/files/reports.jsonl`.
